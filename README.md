# **L**egend of the **Five** **R**ings : Deckbuilder Help

### This is a website that generates a legal L5R deck using card ratings and filters.

The deckbuilding process in L5R is arduous. This website aims to alleviate the problem by allowing users to quickly generate decks without knowing too much/any about the deckbuilding process. It will allow users to quickly generate viable decks to play online or build to take into local play.

## Website Features

---

### **Card Rating Page** - A space that allows users to see the current ratings and vote on cards.

The user will select options from four columns:

**Primary Clan** : This is where most of the cards that you will play in the deck will be from.

**Secondary Clan** : This is where you will be able to add other cards from a different clan into the deck, the amount of this is decided through the influence value on the card.

**Role** : There are two options for this :- 

*Keeper* which allows you to increase your influence limit by 3 (up to 13 total) and access any cards that are **keeper only**
*Seeker* which allows you to add an additional province of that type to your deck. It also gives you 1 fate anytime a province of that type is revealed that round (that you own). It also provides access to cards that are **seeker only**

**Element** : This allows you to access cards that are of that element only, eg. **water role only**.

**VS Clans** : This is where the user is able to select the clans that the deck will cater against and improve the matchup by adding cards that work well against them.

 **The goal for this to ensure that the users is able to generate a deck from scratch that caters towards certain matchups within a minute.**

### **Deck View Page** - A space where after creating a deck, the user will be able to see the cards list or be able to paste the cards into [Jigoku](https://jigoku.online/decks).
